  <h1>JS Atomic 06e</h1>
  <!-- Answer the 3 questions above here -->
  <h2>1. What happens when you try to parse the integer out of a string like `"I am 9 years old"`? How about `"9 is my age"`? Other combinations of numbers and letters? What needs to be true about the incoming string for it to be parsed correctly?</h2>
  <p>"5 is my favorite number" was fine. The program used the 5 wherever it was supposed to. "I choose 7 this time" didn't work. Turned to NaN and spoiled the math wherever the integer should have appeared. So as long as the first thing is the integer parseInt doesn't seem to care what comes after.</p>


### Questions

- Does it matter what order your if-statements are in?
- When testing ranges, did you use `&&`, `||`, or something else entirely (e.g. nested if-statements)? If you used `&&`, why is that a better choice than `||` (and vice-versa)?
- What types of input produce a value of `NaN` after parsing? Is it important to check for `NaN` values? Is it possible for a `NaN` value to trigger any of the other if-statements? If so, how and why?
- What questions do you have?
