  <h2>Does it matter if the user-provided password matches your password exactly, or is there some flexibility allowed in capitalization?</h2>
  <p>My password was "8reindeer" so there was no capitalization. When I changed the password to "reindeer" and entered "Reindeer" at the prompt it was not a match. But I was also using the exact match ===. I tried it with the lenient match == but that did not match either. I think it would be bad form to have the assignment = as the password match so I didn't do it. </p>

  <h2>Why is it a bad idea to store a password (or other sensitive information) in plain text in a Javascript file?</h2>
  <p>Javascript is too accessible to be an adequate place to store passwords and other sensitive information. The Javascript console is just sitting there on the browser.</p>
