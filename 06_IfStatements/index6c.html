  <!-- Answer the 3 questions above here -->
  <h2>1. What is the data-type (e.g. string or integer) of the information that comes in? What happens if the user inputs a number -- does it stay an integer? Use `typeof` and `console.log()` to help with this</h2>
  <p>This from webdevelopernotes.com: It's important to remember that the value returned by prompt() and subsequently stored in a variable will always be a string data type. This is fine if you are dealing with text, but might present problems to the code if you plan to receive numeric data through prompt(). Javascript provides two functions to convert this string value to a numeric data type; parseInt() and parseFloat(). The parseInt() converts a string to an integer value while parseFloat() parses the string converting it to a floating point number.</p>
