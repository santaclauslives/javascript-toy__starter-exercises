  <h1>JS Atomic 02</h1>
  
  <h2>What's the difference between alert() and console.log()?</h2>
  <p>Alert is information for the user. Console.log is something I will need to come back to after some Google searching.</p>
  
  <h2>What's one situation where you might use an `alert()` to tell the user something?</h2>
  <p>It seems like you would use alerts as seldom as possible, but use them if you want to make absolutely certain the user sees the message. For instance, to make sure they want to do what the status of the page suggests they want to do. </p>

  <p>Example: Are you sure you want to exit? You have entered information on this form that will be lost if you exit the page without saving. Example: Maybe a general warning that the content you are going to may not be suitable for the workplace. </p>
  
  <h2>What's one way that `alert()` might get obnoxious?</h2>
  <p>I have the impression "alert" stops everything. Bad example: If your alert behaved like an outbound telemarketer. If you had an alert that said "Are you sure?" followed by, "Maybe you do not realize all of the advantages of staying on this page." </p>

  <h2>Would it make sense to use `console.log()` to tell the user things? Why or why not?</h2>
  <p>One place I stopped on my Google search suggested that not every browser supports console.log. Console.log seems to be more of a way to tell the coder something. </p>

  <h2>What's one way that `console.log()` might be a good tool for you to use?</h2>
  <p>Console.log seems to be a good way for the coder to see what the code is doing. So debugging, kind of like when we put puts in our spielbound program. </p>

  <h2>When do the `console.log()` statements get run? Is it before the first `alert()` gets displayed? After it gets displayed but before the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent)? After the user clicks to close the dialog box? A different time? How did you find out for sure?</h2>
  <p>My understanding is that everything runs top down in javascript. So if you have an alert before the first console.log statment, that alert has to be resolved with an OK or whatever it is requesting, and the dialog box closes. I ran my own answer to this part of the exercise and that's how it went. Not completely sure I did that right, because my opening and closing dialog boxes were both in the way and had to be closed before I could see these answers. </p>

  <h2>What questions do I have?</h2>
  <p>Kind of a silly one, and off topic. In the examples I have seen, I don't see the specific "end" to a loop or a method or a class or what have you like we are used to in Ruby. How does javascript know when to end?
