  <h1>JS Atomic 03</h1>
  <!-- Answer the 3 questions above here -->
  <h2>1. Why don't you need to use the `var` keyword every time you use a variable (right now, we only use it when we create the variable)? What does `var` do?</h2>
  <p>"Var" creates a local variable. We don't need to use the "var" keyword every time we use a variable (I'm thinking this through here and could be wrong) because locally once the variable has been created the program knows what it is. Just must be a property of a Javascript local variable. It's not like you could use that same variable assignment again anywhere else.</p>

  <h2>2. What happens if you try to do output with a variable without first assigning a value to that variable? What happens? Does the program still work as intended? Do error messages show up in the console? If so, what error message?</h2>
  <p>I can't prove it my limited knowledge of Javascript, but it seems to me that with the level of user interaction you have with Javascript, there would be a way for a variable to be "undefined" or "null" until some kind of user input gives it a value.</p>

  <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
  <p>I don't know enough yet to ask intelligent questions. I will probably come back to question 2 and test what happens when a variable is not assigned a value, but I want to get farther in the exercise first. </p>
