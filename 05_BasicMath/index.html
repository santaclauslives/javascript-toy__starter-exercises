  <h1>JS Atomic 05</h1>
  <!-- Answer the 3 questions above here -->
  <h2>1. What happens when you try to parse the integer out of a string like `"I am 9 years old"`? How about `"9 is my age"`? Other combinations of numbers and letters? What needs to be true about the incoming string for it to be parsed correctly?</h2>
  <p>"5 is my favorite number" was fine. The program used the 5 wherever it was supposed to. "I choose 7 this time" didn't work. Turned to NaN and spoiled the math wherever the integer should have appeared. So as long as the first thing is the integer parseInt doesn't seem to care what comes after.</p>

  <h2>What happens if one (or more) of the inputs are non-numeric text (like a comma or a dollar-sign)? What errors occur, if any? What does the console output tell you?</h2>
  <p>I entered $8 as one of my numbers, and got the Not a Number (NaN) indicator wherever that $8 would have occured in the output. Any calculation with $8 also turned into NaN. I did not see anything in the console. It still ran, just showed NaN in the alerts.</p>

  <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
  <p>My incrementing worked with +=1 rather than ++. Is there something I was doing wrong?</p>
